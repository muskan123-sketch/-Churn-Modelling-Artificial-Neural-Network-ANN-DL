# -Churn-Modelling-Artificial-Neural-Network-ANN-DL
In this project ANN model is used to predict given some data about bank customers whether they will leave the bank or not. It is a classification problem . The features under which we will predict the churn rate are: - Geography , Credit Score , Gender , Age , Tenure , Balance , No of products , salary , active member , credit card . The Ann model is trained with some training data then it is used to predict whether a person will leave the band or not.
